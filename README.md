Name - Performing data cleaning and detecting of outliers
Description - To analyze the datasets, I imported the dataset by using the python library called pandas. I performed the data cleaning operation by first
inspecting the datasets(data.info, data.describe etc), I checked for null values and handled the null values by filling the null values, I performed replacing of values,
converting a string column to a numerical column, i performed numerical operations by importing the numpy library, for visualization i imported the matplotlib.plt library and seaborn.
 I detected outliers using the z-score, interquant range and boxplot method. I also defined a callable function for easy access.
